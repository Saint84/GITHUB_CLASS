# Introduction ✨


### 1. Creating a GITHIB Repo.
- Creating a new Repository and follow the next steps:
    - > git init
    - > git remote add origin https://github.com/Saint84/GITHUB_CLASS.git
    - > git push -u origin master or 
    - > git push -f origin master

### 2. My First Commit.
- Perform the follow commands to push the files to GITHUB Repository:
    - > git status
    - > git add .
    - > git commit -m "My FIrst Commit"
    - > git push

### 3. Creating a .gitignore File
A **gitignore** file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected. We are going to ignore an IGNORE.txt file.

### 4. Creating a new Branch.
Now we are going to create a new branch and create a simple python file on the APP directory. To creating a new branch just typing
 - > git branch (New Branch Name)

You can list all branch in this repository using:
 - > git branch
